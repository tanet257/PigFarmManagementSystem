# ✅ Payment Approval Workflow - Implementation Complete

## Status
🟢 **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE & TESTED**

## Problem Statement
User reported: "ผมชำระเงินเรียบร้อย มันดันซ่อน row ที่ชำระเงินไปซะงั้นแล้ว มันก็ไม่เด้งมาในหน้า payment approval"

Translation: "After I recorded payment, the row got hidden and doesn't appear in payment approval page"

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. ✅ PaymentApprovalController only fetched pending PigSale records, NOT pending Payment records
2. ✅ UI had no "Pending Payments" tab to display Payment approval records
3. ✅ No `approvePayment` and `rejectPayment` methods in controller

## Solution Implemented

### 1. ✅ PaymentApprovalController - Enhanced `index()` Method
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/PaymentApprovalController.php` (Lines 21-60)

**Changes:**
- Added query to fetch pending Payment records:
  ```php
  $pendingPayments = \App\Models\Payment::where('status', 'pending')
      ->with(['pigSale.farm', 'pigSale.batch', 'recordedBy'])
      ->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
      ->paginate(15);
  ```

**Result:** Controller now passes `$pendingPayments` to view, making them available for UI display

---

### 2. ✅ PaymentApprovalController - New `approvePayment()` Method
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/PaymentApprovalController.php` (Lines 282-325)

**Functionality:**
- Updates Payment status: `pending` → `approved`
- Sets `approved_by` and `approved_at`
- **CRITICAL**: Calls `RevenueHelper::calculateAndRecordProfit()` to record Profit/Revenue
- Creates notification for payment recorder

**Code Logic:**
```php
public function approvePayment($paymentId)
{
    $payment = Payment::findOrFail($paymentId);
    
    if ($payment->status !== 'pending') {
        return redirect()->back()->with('error', '...');
    }
    
    $payment->update([
        'status' => 'approved',
        'approved_by' => auth()->id(),
        'approved_at' => now(),
    ]);
    
    // Record Profit/Revenue when payment approved
    $pigSale = $payment->pigSale;
    RevenueHelper::calculateAndRecordProfit($pigSale->batch_id);
    
    // Create notification
    Notification::create([...]);
}
```

**Key Point:** Profit is now calculated WHEN PAYMENT IS APPROVED (not when pig sale is approved)

---

### 3. ✅ PaymentApprovalController - New `rejectPayment()` Method
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/PaymentApprovalController.php` (Lines 328-361)

**Functionality:**
- Updates Payment status: `pending` → `rejected`
- Sets `approved_by` and `approved_at` for audit trail
- Creates notification for payment recorder

---

### 4. ✅ Payment Approvals UI - New "Pending Payments" Tab
**File:** `resources/views/admin/payment_approvals/index.blade.php` (Lines 43-58)

**Added:**
```blade
<li class="nav-item">
    <a class="nav-link active" id="pending-payment-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" href="#pending-payment" role="tab">
        <i class="bi bi-wallet"></i> รอการอนุมัติชำระเงิน
        <span class="badge bg-danger ms-2">{{ $pendingPayments->total() ?? 0 }}</span>
    </a>
</li>
```

**Features:**
- Badge shows count of pending payments
- First tab (default active)
- Icon: wallet (<i class="bi bi-wallet"></i>)
- Label: "รอการอนุมัติชำระเงิน" (Pending Payment Approval)

---

### 5. ✅ Payment Tab Content Section
**File:** `resources/views/admin/payment_approvals/index.blade.php` (Lines 61-158)

**Displays:**
| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| เลขที่เอกสาร | Payment number |
| เกษตรกร / ฟาร์ม | Farm name + Farmer name |
| ชื่อแบทช์ | Batch name (with code) |
| จำนวนเงิน | Amount formatted as ฿X,XXX.XX |
| วิธีชำระเงิน | Payment method (cash/transfer/cheque) - with colored badge |
| วันที่ชำระเงิน | Payment date (d/m/Y format) |
| ไฟล์ใบเสร็จ | Download link to receipt PDF (if exists) |
| บันทึกโดย | Recorded by user + timestamp |
| การกระทำ | Approve/Reject buttons |

**Action Buttons:**
- ✅ **Approve Button**: Green - calls `payment_approvals.approve_payment` route
- ❌ **Reject Button**: Red - calls `payment_approvals.reject_payment` route
- Both methods: `@method('PATCH')` to match routes

**Empty State:**
```blade
⏳ ไม่มีการชำระเงินที่รอการอนุมัติ (No pending payments)
```

---

### 6. ✅ Updated PigSale Tab
**File:** `resources/views/admin/payment_approvals/index.blade.php` (Line 159)

**Change:**
- Changed from `tab-pane fade show active` → `tab-pane fade` (no longer default active)
- Moved after Pending Payments tab
- ID remains `id="pending"` for backward compatibility

---

### 7. ✅ Routes Configuration
**File:** `routes/web.php` (Lines 243-244)

**Routes already exist:**
```php
Route::patch('/{paymentId}/approve-payment', [PaymentApprovalController::class, 'approvePayment'])->name('payment_approvals.approve_payment');
Route::patch('/{paymentId}/reject-payment', [PaymentApprovalController::class, 'rejectPayment'])->name('payment_approvals.reject_payment');
```

**HTTP Method:** PATCH (correct for status updates)

---

## User Workflow - Before & After

### ❌ BEFORE (Bug)
1. User records payment for pig sale → Payment created with `status='pending'`
2. User goes to Payment Approvals page
3. 🔴 **BUG**: Payment records don't appear (pig sale row hidden, not in approval page)
4. User confused: "Where is my payment record?"

### ✅ AFTER (Fixed)
1. User records payment for pig sale → Payment created with `status='pending'`
2. User goes to Payment Approvals page
3. ✅ **NEW**: First tab shows "รอการอนุมัติชำระเงิน" (Pending Payments) with badge count
4. User clicks Approve button
5. ✅ **NEW**: `approvePayment()` method:
   - Updates Payment `status='approved'`
   - Calls `RevenueHelper::calculateAndRecordProfit()` to record Profit/Revenue
   - Creates notification
6. ✅ System calculates total revenue/profit from approved payments only
7. ✅ Row updates in table (status change visible)

## Data Flow - Payment Approval to Profit

```
Payment recorded (status='pending')
         ↓
Admin views Payment Approvals page
         ↓
Clicks "Approve" button
         ↓
PaymentApprovalController::approvePayment($paymentId)
         ├─ Update Payment.status = 'approved'
         ├─ Set approved_by = auth()->id()
         ├─ Set approved_at = now()
         └─ RevenueHelper::calculateAndRecordProfit($batch_id) ✅ KEY STEP
                ├─ Sum approved Payments.amount
                ├─ Sum approved dead pig revenue (quantity_sold_total × price_per_pig)
                ├─ Calculate costs
                ├─ Calculate profit = total_revenue - total_cost
                └─ Record in Profit/Revenue tables
         ↓
Notification sent to payment recorder
         ↓
Admin sees updated values in Revenue/Profit reports
```
