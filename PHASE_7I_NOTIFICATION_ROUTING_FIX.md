# Phase 7I: Payment Notification Routing Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Fixed incorrect notification routing where PigEntry payment notifications were being sent to the Payment Approvals page instead of the Cost Payment Approvals page.

## Problem
When a user recorded PigEntry payment through the payment modal:
- ❌ Notification appeared on "อนุมัติการชำระเงิน" (Payment Approvals) page
- ❌ But should appear on "อนุมัติการชำระเงินค่าใช้จ่าย" (Cost Payment Approvals) page
- ❌ Resulted in duplicate/wrong notifications

**Root Cause**: 
- PigEntry payment creates a **CostPayment record** (not a Payment record)
- But the notification was pointing to `payment_approvals.index` route
- And using `PigEntryRecord` as related_model instead of `CostPayment`

## Solution

### 1. Updated NotificationHelper.php
Changed `notifyAdminsPigEntryPaymentRecorded()` method to:
- Accept **CostPayment** object instead of PigEntryRecord
- Point to `cost_payment_approvals.index` route
- Use `CostPayment` as related_model
- Store CostPayment ID in related_model_id

```php
// BEFORE
public static function notifyAdminsPigEntryPaymentRecorded($pigEntryRecord, User $recordedBy)
{
    // ...
    'url' => route('payment_approvals.index'),  // ❌ WRONG
    'related_model' => 'PigEntryRecord',        // ❌ WRONG
    'related_model_id' => $pigEntryRecord->id,  // ❌ WRONG
}

// AFTER
public static function notifyAdminsPigEntryPaymentRecorded($costPayment, User $recordedBy)
{
    $cost = $costPayment->cost;
    $batch = $cost->batch;
    $farm = $cost->farm;
    
    // ...
    'url' => route('cost_payment_approvals.index'),  // ✅ CORRECT
    'related_model' => 'CostPayment',                // ✅ CORRECT
    'related_model_id' => $costPayment->id,          // ✅ CORRECT
}
```

### 2. Updated PigEntryController.php
Changed `update_payment()` method to:
- Create CostPayment first
- Pass CostPayment to notification helper
- Send to Cost Payment Approvals page

```php
// Create CostPayment
$costPayment = CostPayment::create([...]);

// Send notification with CostPayment
NotificationHelper::notifyAdminsPigEntryPaymentRecorded($costPayment, auth()->user());
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/Helpers/NotificationHelper.php`
- Method: `notifyAdminsPigEntryPaymentRecorded()`
- Changed parameter from PigEntryRecord to CostPayment
- Updated route to cost_payment_approvals.index
- Updated related_model to CostPayment
- Updated notification message to use Cost data

### 2. `app/Http/Controllers/PigEntryController.php`
- Method: `update_payment()`
- Store CostPayment in variable
- Pass CostPayment to notification helper

## Notification Routing - NOW CORRECT

### PigEntry Payment Flow
```
1. User records PigEntry payment via paymentmodal
   ↓
2. Cost record created
   ↓
3. CostPayment record created
   ↓
4. Notification created for CostPayment
   ↓
5. Admin sees notification on "อนุมัติการชำระเงินค่าใช้จ่าย" page ✅
   (Cost Payment Approvals - correct page)
```

### PigSale Payment Flow
```
1. User records PigSale payment
   ↓
2. Payment record created
   ↓
3. Notification created for Payment
   ↓
4. Admin sees notification on "อนุมัติการชำระเงิน" page ✅
   (Payment Approvals - correct page)
```

## Data Model Mapping

| Type | Record Model | Notification Route | Related Model | Purpose |
|------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| PigEntry Payment | CostPayment | cost_payment_approvals | CostPayment | Cost payment approval |
| PigSale Payment | Payment | payment_approvals | PigSale | Sales payment approval |

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ PigEntry payments showed on wrong page (Payment Approvals)
- ❌ Confusing for admin (2 similar pages with mixed data)
- ❌ Related model was wrong (PigEntryRecord instead of CostPayment)

### After Fix
- ✅ PigEntry payments show on correct page (Cost Payment Approvals)
- ✅ Clear separation between payment types
- ✅ Correct related models for linking

## PHP Syntax Validation ✅
```
✅ NotificationHelper.php - No syntax errors
✅ PigEntryController.php - No syntax errors
```

## Related to Phase 7

This fix is related to Phase 7H (Payment Approvals Cancellation) as it ensures notifications are correctly associated with the right approval type (Payment vs CostPayment).
