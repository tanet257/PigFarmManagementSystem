# Phase 7H: Payment Approvals Cancellation - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Added comprehensive handling of payment approvals when batch is cancelled. This ensures that:
1. **Payment records** (for PigSale) are automatically rejected when batch is cancelled
2. **CostPayment records** (for Cost approvals) are automatically rejected
3. **Payment notifications** are marked with "[ยกเลิกแล้ว]" status
4. All payment approval records reflect the batch cancellation

## Root Cause
When a batch was cancelled, the system was not updating Payment and CostPayment approval records. This meant:
- ❌ Payment records for pig sales still showed as "pending" approval
- ❌ Cost payment approvals still showed as "approved"
- ❌ Users could still approve already-cancelled sales/costs
- ❌ Financial records didn't match actual business state

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Payment Records Handling
When batch is cancelled, all Payment records (from PigSale) are automatically:
- Status changed from `pending` → `rejected`
- `rejected_by` set to: `'System - Batch Cancelled'`
- `rejected_at` set to: current timestamp
- `reject_reason` set to: `'Batch cancelled - Payment automatically rejected'`

```php
// If PigSale IDs found from cancelled batch:
Payment::whereIn('pig_sale_id', $pigSaleIds)
    ->where('status', '!=', 'rejected')  // Skip already rejected
    ->update([
        'status' => 'rejected',
        'rejected_by' => 'System - Batch Cancelled',
        'rejected_at' => now(),
        'reject_reason' => 'Batch cancelled - Payment automatically rejected',
    ]);
```

### 2. CostPayment Records Handling
When batch is cancelled, all CostPayment records (from Cost) are automatically:
- Status changed from `approved`/`pending` → `rejected`
- `cancelled_at` set to: current timestamp

```php
// If Cost IDs found from cancelled batch:
CostPayment::whereIn('cost_id', $costIds)
    ->where('status', '!=', 'rejected')  // Skip already rejected
    ->update([
        'status' => 'rejected',
        'cancelled_at' => now(),
    ]);
```

### 3. Payment Notification Marking
Payment notifications are marked with `[ยกเลิกแล้ว]` prefix:
- For each PigSale in the cancelled batch
- Find Payment records linked to PigSale
- Find Notification records for Payment
- Update title with `[ยกเลิกแล้ว]` prefix if not already marked

```php
// Mark Payment notifications
$paymentIds = Payment::whereIn('pig_sale_id', $pigSaleIds)->pluck('id')->toArray();
$paymentNotifications = Notification::where('related_model', 'Payment')
    ->whereIn('related_model_id', $paymentIds)
    ->get();

foreach ($paymentNotifications as $notification) {
    if (!str_contains($notification->title, '[ยกเลิกแล้ว]')) {
        $notification->update([
            'title' => '[ยกเลิกแล้ว] ' . $notification->title,
        ]);
    }
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/Helpers/PigInventoryHelper.php`

**Changes in `deleteBatchWithAllocations()` method:**
- Added Payment handling after PigSale cancellation
- Added CostPayment handling after Cost cancellation
- Added Payment notification marking in `markBatchAndRelatedNotificationsAsCancelled()`

**Additions:**
```php
// Line ~565-580: After PigSale update
// Payment approvals for PigSale
Payment::whereIn('pig_sale_id', $pigSaleIds)
    ->where('status', '!=', 'rejected')
    ->update([...]);

// Line ~600-613: After Cost update  
// CostPayment approvals
CostPayment::whereIn('cost_id', $costIds)
    ->where('status', '!=', 'rejected')
    ->update([...]);

// Line ~680-710: In notification marking
// Payment notification handling
```

## Test Results

### `test_payment_approvals_cancellation.php` ✅ ALL 7 TESTS PASSED

**Test 1: Setup test data with payments**
- ✅ Created batch, pig sale, payment, cost, cost payment
- ✅ Initial state correct (Payment: pending, CostPayment: approved)

**Test 2: Verify initial state before cancellation**
- ✅ Payment status: pending
- ✅ CostPayment status: approved

**Test 3: Cancel batch and verify payment approvals are rejected**
- ✅ Batch cancelled successfully
- ✅ Result message correct

**Test 4: Verify Payment status changed to rejected**
- ✅ Payment status: rejected
- ✅ rejected_by: "System - Batch Cancelled"
- ✅ reject_reason: Set correctly

**Test 5: Verify CostPayment status changed to rejected**
- ✅ CostPayment status: rejected
- ✅ cancelled_at: Set to current timestamp

**Test 6: Verify Payment notification marked with [ยกเลิกแล้ว]**
- ✅ Payment notification title includes "[ยกเลิกแล้ว]"

**Test 7: Verify CostPayment notification marked with [ยกเลิกแล้ว]**
- ✅ CostPayment notification title includes "[ยกเลิกแล้ว]"

## PHP Syntax Validation ✅
```
✅ PigInventoryHelper.php - No syntax errors
```

## Impact & Benefits

### Before Phase 7H
- ❌ Payment approvals remained "pending" after batch cancel
- ❌ Cost payment approvals remained "approved" after batch cancel
- ❌ Users could approve already-cancelled transactions
- ❌ Financial data inconsistent with actual business state

### After Phase 7H
- ✅ Payment approvals automatically rejected with batch
- ✅ Cost payment approvals automatically rejected with batch
- ✅ Users cannot approve cancelled transactions
- ✅ Financial data stays consistent with actual state
- ✅ Clear audit trail (system marked rejection)
- ✅ Notifications show cancellation status

## Data Flow

```
Batch Cancelled (status='cancelled')
    ↓
PigSale [ยกเลิกการขาย] ← Already handled in Phase 7D
    ├─ Payment: pending/approved → rejected ✅ NEW
    ├─ Notification: [ยกเลิกแล้ว] ✅ NEW
Cost [payment_status='ยกเลิก'] ← Already handled in Phase 7D
    ├─ CostPayment: approved/pending → rejected ✅ NEW
    ├─ Notification: [ยกเลิกแล้ว] ✅ NEW
```

## Database Changes

### Payment Table Updates
- `status`: pending/approved → rejected
- `rejected_by`: Set to 'System - Batch Cancelled'
- `rejected_at`: Set to current timestamp
- `reject_reason`: Set to cancellation reason

### CostPayment Table Updates
- `status`: approved/pending → rejected
- `cancelled_at`: Set to current timestamp

### No Schema Changes Required ✅
- All fields already exist
- No migrations needed
- Pure data update logic

## Performance Impact
- ✅ Minimal impact
- ✅ Uses bulk update (efficient)
- ✅ Only affects cancelled batch records
- ✅ Runs as part of existing cascade logic

## Security & Audit Trail
- ✅ System automatically rejects (not user action)
- ✅ Clear audit trail with system rejection marker
- ✅ Prevents manual approval of cancelled items
- ✅ Consistent with financial compliance
