# 🎉 Phase 7H: Payment Approvals Cancellation - COMPLETE

## Quick Summary

**Problem**: When a batch is cancelled, Payment and CostPayment approval records were not being updated. This left approval records in an invalid state.

**Solution**: Added automatic rejection of all payment approvals when batch is cancelled.

**Result**: ✅ **7/7 tests passing** - Payment approvals now properly cancelled with batch

## What Was Changed

### PigInventoryHelper.php - `deleteBatchWithAllocations()` Method

#### 1. Added Payment Rejection (After PigSale Cancellation)
```php
// If PigSale IDs exist for the batch
$pigSaleIds = PigSale::where('batch_id', $batchId)->pluck('id')->toArray();

if (!empty($pigSaleIds)) {
    // Reject all Payment records for these pig sales
    Payment::whereIn('pig_sale_id', $pigSaleIds)
        ->where('status', '!=', 'rejected')
        ->update([
            'status' => 'rejected',
            'rejected_by' => 'System - Batch Cancelled',
            'rejected_at' => now(),
            'reject_reason' => 'Batch cancelled - Payment automatically rejected',
        ]);
}
```

#### 2. Added CostPayment Rejection (After Cost Cancellation)
```php
// If Cost IDs exist for the batch
$costIds = Cost::where('batch_id', $batchId)->pluck('id')->toArray();

if (!empty($costIds)) {
    // Reject all CostPayment records for these costs
    CostPayment::whereIn('cost_id', $costIds)
        ->where('status', '!=', 'rejected')
        ->update([
            'status' => 'rejected',
            'cancelled_at' => now(),
        ]);
}
```

#### 3. Added Notification Marking for Payment
```php
// In markBatchAndRelatedNotificationsAsCancelled()
// Mark Payment notifications with [ยกเลิกแล้ว]
$paymentIds = Payment::whereIn('pig_sale_id', $pigSaleIds)->pluck('id')->toArray();

if (!empty($paymentIds)) {
    $paymentNotifications = Notification::where('related_model', 'Payment')
        ->whereIn('related_model_id', $paymentIds)
        ->get();

    foreach ($paymentNotifications as $notification) {
        if (!str_contains($notification->title, '[ยกเลิกแล้ว]')) {
            $notification->update([
                'title' => '[ยกเลิกแล้ว] ' . $notification->title,
            ]);
        }
    }
}
```

## Test File Created

**File**: `test_payment_approvals_cancellation.php`

**Tests (7 total)**:
1. ✅ Setup test data with payments
2. ✅ Verify initial state before cancellation
3. ✅ Cancel batch and verify payment approvals are rejected
4. ✅ Verify Payment status changed to rejected
5. ✅ Verify CostPayment status changed to rejected
6. ✅ Verify Payment notification marked with [ยกเลิกแล้ว]
7. ✅ Verify CostPayment notification marked with [ยกเลิกแล้ว]

**Results**: 
```
Tests Passed: 7
Tests Failed: 0
Total Tests:  7

✅ ALL TESTS PASSED!
Payment approvals are correctly cancelled with batch.
```

## Validation

**PHP Syntax**: ✅ No errors in PigInventoryHelper.php
