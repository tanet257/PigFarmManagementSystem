# ✅ Cancel Request Approval Workflow - COMPLETE

## Overview

The cancel request approval workflow is **fully implemented and ready for testing**. The system now requires admin approval for pig sale cancellations, preventing accidental or unauthorized cancellations.

## What Was Built

### 1. **Cancel Request Workflow**
- User requests cancellation → Creates Notification (pending)
- Admin reviews request in dashboard → Can approve or reject
- If approved → Sale cancelled, pigs returned, profit recalculated
- If rejected → Sale remains active, user can retry or record payment

### 2. **UI Updates - payment_approvals/index.blade.php**

#### Pending Tab
- **New Section**: Pending Cancel Requests
- Shows: Sale ID, Quantity, Requester, Date, Reason
- Actions: Approve (green) or Reject (red) buttons
- Badges show count of pending items
- Both payment approvals and cancel requests displayed

#### Approved Tab
- **New Section**: Approved Cancellations  
- Shows completed cancellations with approval date
- View-only display
- Separate from regular payment approvals

#### Rejected Tab
- **New Section**: Rejected Cancellations
- Shows cancelled requests with rejection reason
- View-only display
- Separate from regular payment rejections

### 3. **Modal Dialogs**

#### Approve Cancel Modal
```
Title: "อนุมัติการยกเลิกการขาย"
Shows: Original cancellation reason
Fields: Optional approval notes
Button: "อนุมัติการยกเลิก"
```

#### Reject Cancel Modal
```
Title: "ปฏิเสธการยกเลิกการขาย"
Shows: Original cancellation reason
Fields: Required rejection reason
Button: "ปฏิเสธ"
```

### 4. **Backend Integration**

#### Controller Methods
- `PaymentApprovalController::approveCancelSale($notificationId)`
  - Updates notification status to 'approved'
  - Calls `PigSaleController::confirmCancel()`
  - Returns pigs to batch
  - Soft deletes sale
  - Recalculates profit
  
- `PaymentApprovalController::rejectCancelSale(Request, $notificationId)`
  - Validates rejection_reason (required)
  - Updates notification status to 'rejected'
  - Sale remains active
  - User can request again

#### Routes
- `PATCH /payment_approvals/{notificationId}/approve-cancel-sale`
- `PATCH /payment_approvals/{notificationId}/reject-cancel-sale`

#### Data Model
- Notifications table with type='cancel_pig_sale'
- Tracks: approval_status (pending/approved/rejected)
- Stores: approval_notes, rejection_reason

## Key Features

### ✅ Status Summary Integration
- Pending badge includes: payments + cancels + pig_entry payments
- Approved badge includes: payments + cancels + pig_entry payments
- Rejected badge includes: payments + cancels + pig_entry payments

### ✅ Tab Navigation
- **Pending**: All approvals needed (payments + cancels)
- **Approved**: All completed approvals
- **Rejected**: All rejections with reasons

### ✅ Conditional Display
- Payment modal only shows if payment_status != 'ยกเลิกการขาย'
- Cancel button only shows if payment_status != 'ยกเลิกการขาย'
- Cancel sections only display if records exist

### ✅ Independent Pagination
- Each section (payments, cancels, pig_entry) has own pagination
- Users can navigate through data independently
- Default: 15 items per page

### ✅ User Notifications
- Admin sees count badge for pending items
- Modal shows original reason for cancel request
- Rejection reason displayed to requester

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
1. **Notification System**
   - Uses same Notification model
   - Type-based filtering
   - Status tracking

2. **Payment System**
   - Reuses payment approval patterns
   - Integrates with profit calculation
   - Uses same dashboard

3. **Revenue/Profit System**
   - RevenueHelper.calculateAndRecordProfit()
   - Only recalculates on approval
   - Filters cancelled records

4. **Pig Inventory**
   - Returns pigs to batch/pen on approval
   - Uses PigSaleController::confirmCancel()
   - Inventory stays consistent

## Configuration

### Optional Settings
- Pagination: Currently 15 items/page (configurable)
- Modal behavior: Supports with/without ajax
- Notification type: Currently 'cancel_pig_sale' (extensible)

### No Configuration Required
- Database tables already exist
- Controllers already implemented
- Routes already registered
- All features working out of the box

## Known Limitations

1. **PigEntry Cancellation**
   - Not yet implemented with approval workflow
   - Can be added following same pattern
   - Requires similar changes to PigEntry model/controller

2. **Email Notifications**
   - No email alerts to admin (can be added)
   - No email to user on approval/rejection
   - Could use Laravel Mail

3. **Bulk Actions**
   - Cannot approve multiple at once
   - Each must be approved individually
   - Could be added if needed

4. **Time-based Expiry**
   - No automatic expiry of pending requests
   - Could be added with scheduled jobs

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2
1. Email notifications on approval/rejection
2. PigEntry cancellation approval workflow
3. Bulk approve/reject actions
4. Request timeout handling

### Phase 3
1. Custom rejection reasons (pre-defined list)
2. Two-level approval (supervisor → director)
3. Cancellation reason analytics
4. SLA tracking (how long approval takes)

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Cancel request not appearing in dashboard?**
A: Check database
```sql
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE type = 'cancel_pig_sale' 
AND approval_status = 'pending'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Q: Can't click approve/reject buttons?**
A: Check routes are registered
```bash
php artisan route:list | grep cancel
```

**Q: Modal not opening?**
A: Check Bootstrap JS is loaded
```html
<!-- In header -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

**Q: Error on form submission?**
A: Check routes match controller method names
```php
// routes/web.php should match:
Route::patch('/{notificationId}/approve-cancel-sale', 
    [PaymentApprovalController::class, 'approveCancelSale'])
    ->name('payment_approvals.approve_cancel_sale');
```
